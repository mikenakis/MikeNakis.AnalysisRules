	<!-- PEARL: Visual studio makes it difficult to open .csproj files for editing, keeps modifying .csproj files as we 
		are editing them, (sometimes messing them up,) keeps reloading them each time we save them, (and with each
		reload it scrolls to the top,) etc.
		As an example, if you have something like &#169; in a project file, it will sooner or later be replaced by
		Visual Studio with the unicode character for the copyright sign. 
		The solution to all this madness is to put nothing in .csproj files but a single statement which imports another
		file with an extension that is not .csproj, so that Visual Studio will leave that file alone.-->
